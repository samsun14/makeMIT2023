#Ecobins is a smart trash-can with an array of features that enables users to efficiently sort their waste and play an individual part in mitigating the global climate change crisis. Most central is Ecobin’s image recognition algorithm that differentiates between recyclables and non-recyclables and informs users in real time so that they can correspondingly dispose of their waste. Ecobins uses a motion sensing lid to react to the user’s presence and allow for practical disposal of waste, making the user experience smoother. Depending on the output of the AI algorithm that classifies any given waste as recyclable or as trash, the user presses buttons that control the flow of waste so that waste is effectively sorted. This interactive process not only informs users of how to dispose of any given waste, but it also equips them with an expanded knowledge of how items should be disposed of.
